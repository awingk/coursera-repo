Data Analytics
===============

Previous Data(What happened in the Past) 					 <- Descriptive Analytics
Future(What's going to happen?)		 						 <- Predictive Analytics
What Should I do to make best use of what's going to happen  <- Prescriptive Analytics

Phases of Data Analytics
=========================

Software Cycle									Data Analytics
---------------									---------------
1. Requirement Gathering						Problem Statement (SMART- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound)
2. Plan & Design								Solution Design/Identification (Predictive Sales, Logistic Regression, Cluster Analysis etc.)
3. Development									Solution Implementation (Data Exploration, Data Preparation, Data Partitioning, Modeling)
4. Testing(QC)									(Partitioning - Training Dataset, Testing Dataset; Solution Validation)
5. Deployment									Solution Deployment
6. Maintenance									Solution Monitoring

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation.

Dataset A = {17, 4, 33,2, 51, 23, 3, 41, 18, 2, 4, 2}

Measures of Central Tendency
=============================
1. Mean 	= 16.66667
2. Median 	= (4 + 17) / 2 = 10.5		(The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample.)
3. Mode		= 2						(The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears most often.)

Measure of Range
=================
1. Min
2. Max
3. Range
4. Variance


Chebyshev's theorem: The proportion of data between k std. deviation is at least (1- (1/k^2)).
(Applicable on non-skewed data.)

Empirical Rule: 68 - 95 - 99.7%
(Normal Distribution)

-> 68 %  lies b/w one Std. Dev
-> 95%   lies b/w 2 * Std. Dev
-> 99.7% lies b/w 3 * Std. Dev

Boxplot
========

Min			= 1
Q1			= 40
Median		= 142
Q3			= 281
Max			= 977

Measures of Shape
==================

Bell - shaped, Right Skewed, Left Skewed

skew - 0 : Normal; > 1 : Right Skewed; < 0 : Left Skewed or Negative Skewed

Mesokurtic, Leptokurtic, Platykurtic

When a random variable has only 2 possible outcome we call it binomial variable.

- Binomial, Poisson, Negative Binomial

Hypothesis Testing Class Workbook.xlsx
=======================================

H0: Team Engagement score is 85%
Ha: Team Engagement is lower than 85%
p-value: P(Random chance Variation)

If p-value is low, reject H0
If p-value is high, accept H0

Significance Level: alpha

p-value: P(Observing outcomes as extreme or more extreme than observed value due to random chance.)
